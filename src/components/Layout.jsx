// Here, the Outlet component acts as a placeholder where the child components (<Home />, <About />, and <Contact />) defined within the nested Route components will be rendered.


//In the context of React and the React Router library, the <Outlet /> component serves a specific purpose. It is used as a placeholder or a target where child routes will be rendered.

// When you define routes in React Router, you may have nested routes that correspond to specific components or views within your application. These nested routes are typically rendered within a parent component, and the <Outlet /> component is used to determine the location where those nested routes should be rendered.
// To summarize, the Outlet component is used to render the components specified in the child routes of a given route configuration in react-router-dom.
